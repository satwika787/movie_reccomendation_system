A movie recommendation system based on Content filtering using Cosine Similarity to provide personalized movie suggestions.

This project implements a movie recommender system using the _TMBD Movie Dataset_. 
The system recommends movies to users based on their preferences by analyzing movie overviews and genres. 
It utilizes the _CountVectorizer_ from the _scikit-learn_ library for _feature extraction_ and _cosine similarity_ to calculate the similarity between movies.
